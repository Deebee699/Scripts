Use Office Scripts to Move Rows Between Tables

Learn how to use the "record actions" button in Excel Automate tab and record an Office Scripts. With Office Scripts we'll create a macro that works on both Excel desktop and Excel online. In this example, I'll show you how to create a script to automatically move rows from one sheet to another sheet every single day. 

Many of us have to maintain and update task or to-do lists in Excel. Wouldn't it be nice if tasks marked as "Complete" or "Done" are moved to an Archive automatically at the end of each day. So, next time you open the task tracker only open tasks are shown on your to-do list?

For example, you've created an Excel table to collect all the tasks your team is working on. At the end of the day, you want to move all the "Complete" or "Done" tasks to another Excel table. Instead of doing it yourself every single day, you can fully automate it. I'll show you how to create an Office Script to move rows from one table and append it to the bottom of another table based on a logic. I'll also show you how to let the script run automatically at a scheduled time using Power Automate. We'll set up a flow that runs the script every day. This way you don't need to worry about running the script yourself. Power Automate will run automatically.
